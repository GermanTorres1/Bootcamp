         <p> <strong> Lorem Ipsum  </strong> is simply dummy </p>
          <p> <b> text of the printing </b>  and typesetting industry. </p>
         <p> <i> Lorem Ipsum has </i> been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
         <p> <em> when an unknown printer took  </em> a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type </p>
         <mark>specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
            the 1960s with </mark> the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
         and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
         including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
